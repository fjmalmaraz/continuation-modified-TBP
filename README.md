This is the code and a working document  written in 2005 about the numerical continuation  of a modified potential of the three body problem (TBP) starting by the figure 8 discovered by Chenciner and Montgomery(2000). We have released the code to be properly cited by Dr. Toshiaki Fujiwara.

## Numerical continuation 
For numerical continuation, it is required AUTO software
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/auto-07p/][auto]

[auto]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/auto-07p/

To download this repository, please type 

> git clone https://github.com/fjmalmaraz/continuation-modified-TBP.git

For continuation with respect to  time-reversal symmetry generated by reflection with respect to y-axis for bodies 2 and 3, type the following command

> auto familyM1.auto


For continuation with respect to time-reversal symmetry generated by $E_1$ 180-rotation for the bodies 2 and 3, type the following command

> auto familyE1.auto

For continuation following the general scheme for periodic orbit, type

> auto familygen.auto

## Report

In the folder `report`, a pdf file with additional comments of the original working document is available. The document is composed with the command `make`.
