\begin{abstract}
  This is a working document distributed in 2005 among our group and other
  researchers interested about bifurcation for numerical continuation
  of modified potential of the three body problem (TBP) starting from
  the figure-8. In 2018, Dr.~Toshiaki Fujiwara told us that he was
  going to cite our private communication about the topic. Therefore,
 this document is making publicly available that communication as well
 as the code for numerical continuation  with AUTO. The body of this
 document consist in the working document of 2005. 
\end{abstract}
We are going to study central forces 
\begin{equation}
H=\frac 1 2 (\| \mathbf{p}_1\|^2 +\| \mathbf{p}_2\|^2+ \| \mathbf{p}_3\|^2) - \frac 1 {\|  \mathbf{q}_1-\mathbf{q}_2\|^{\alpha}}
-\frac 1 {\|  \mathbf{q}_1-\mathbf{q}_3\|^{\alpha}}-\frac 1 {\|  \mathbf{q}_2-\mathbf{q}_3\|^{\alpha}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{p}_1$, $\mathbf{p}_2$, $\mathbf{p}_3$, $\mathbf{q}_1$, $\mathbf{q}_2$ and  $\mathbf{q}_3$ 
are vectors on the plane.

The bifurcation diagram displayed above has as horizontal axis the exponent in the potential of Hamiltonian, $\alpha$, 
and the vertical axis is the norm $L^2$ given by AUTO as output. I do not know why it could not be the pink curve and  the red curve tangent.
The red curve is the family where the figure-eight is. This red family goes from $\alpha=1$ up to very high values for $\alpha$, in the other 
direction is going to go from $\alpha=1$ up to close to $\alpha=0$. Every orbit in the family is the three bodies following a curve with figure eight. 
Characteristic multipliers are shown in the following picture

\end{tabular}

The red family is symmetric with respect to the two time-reversal symmetries of the figure eight. The continuation 
with both of them allows us to find two bifurcation points at $\alpha= 0.996562$  and $\alpha= 1.34242$. However, the other two bifurcation 
are not detected with the symmetric continuation. They are not detected with the method for period orbit. The two detected bifurcation have a 
``passing'' behauvior (the characteristic multiplier pass through the one and stays on the unit circle) and the undetected are ``splitting'' (there exists a
change in the linear stability). The undetected are more or less close to $\alpha=1.2283$ and $\alpha=2$. Is $\alpha=2$ a special point.

From the bifurcation point at $\alpha= 0.996562$, a family of doubly symmetric periodic orbits appears. In the diagram is the pink curve. 
This family looks like tangent to the red curve, I should check it. I do not understand which is the reason because od these curves can not be tangent. I would thank an explanation.  Here some orbits of the family in a direction:

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/o1.pdf}&
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/o2.pdf} \\
$\alpha= 0.98974558119$&$ \alpha=0.97657871845 $
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/o3.pdf}&
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/o4.pdf}\\
$\alpha= 0.92520305647$&$ \alpha= 0.86299535233$
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/o5.pdf}&
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/o6.pdf}\\
$\alpha= 0.81555487427$&$ \alpha=0.84462774170 $
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/o7.pdf}&
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/o8.pdf}\\
$\alpha=0.88342919391 $&$ \alpha=0.90984042548 $
\end{tabular}

In the opposite direction from the bifurcation, we have displayed some periodic orbits: 

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/b1.pdf}&
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/b2.pdf}\\
$\alpha=1.0025843346 $&$ \alpha= 1.0101864584$
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/b3.pdf}&
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/b4.pdf}\\
$\alpha= 1.0215325651$&$ \alpha= 1.0265396023$
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/b5.pdf}&
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/b6.pdf}\\
$\alpha= 1.0265820623$&$ \alpha= 1.0244124526$
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/b7.pdf}&
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./orbits/b8.pdf}\\
$\alpha= 1.0137412091$&$ \alpha= 1.0005848879$
\end{tabular}

About the above family, I am surprised because they look like the orbits in the family which belongs the figure eight when one of the  masses is varied. 

From the other bifurcation  at $\alpha= 1.34242$ appears the family which correspond to the green curve in the above bifurcation diagram. This family is also symmetric with respect to the two time-reversal symmetries.  Again, there are some orbits from this family.
